% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
    This is a sample open source scientific article automatically generated using the \texttt{showyourwork} package. 
    The icons in the right margin of the abstract link to the \texttt{GitHub} repository containing the source code and to the build logs for the workflow that generated this PDF on \texttt{GitHub Actions}.

% Main body
\section{Introduction}
This article was automatically generated from a repository containing a TeX file,
a \texttt{conda} environment file, some \texttt{Python} figure scripts, and a \texttt{Snakefile} with custom instructions for downloading external datasets.
Edit the TeX file, figure scripts, and \texttt{Snakefile} as needed, and whenever you commit and push your changes to \texttt{GitHub}, this PDF will automatically regenerate on \texttt{GitHub Actions}. Please check out the \texttt{showyourwork} \href{https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork}{repository} for more information.

% A sample two-panel figure

            A sample plot with two subpanels. 
            Both figures were generated from the same \texttt{Python} script in the \texttt{figures} directory. 
            The name of the script is inferred from the figure label in the TeX file.
        }
        % This label tells showyourwork that the script `figures/fractals.py'
        % generates the two PDF files included above
        \label{fig:fractals}
    \end{centering}

            Another sample plot. 
            This one was generated from a dataset hosted on Zenodo; the instructions for downloading this dataset are specified in the \texttt{Snakefile}.
